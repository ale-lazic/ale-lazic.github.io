#### Public communication about vaccination and health

How do online media report about alternative medicine? I led a content analysis study as part of the Reason4Health project. [Read the paper](https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.82189). [Generate random news stories!](https://perchance.org/r4h-generator-eng)

How do online media report about vaccination rates? [Read the paper](https://psyarxiv.com/nqjb9/) stemming from my PhD project.

How should public messaging leverage vaccination rates? Is better to emphasize individual or social benefits of vaccination? [Read the preprint](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/3h5bk) and the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12556) also stemming from my PhD project.

Why should we use stories to counter anti-vaccination conspiracy theories? [Read our paper](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/g5r8z).
