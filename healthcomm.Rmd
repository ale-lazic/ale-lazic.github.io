## Public communication about vaccination and health

How do online media report about alternative medicine? [Read the paper](https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.82189), reporting a content analysis study I led as part of the Reason4Health project. [Or try our generator random news stories!](https://perchance.org/r4h-generator-eng)

How should public messaging leverage vaccination rates? And is it better to emphasize individual or social benefits of vaccination? [Read the preprint](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/3h5bk) and the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12556), reporting experimental and survey studies from my PhD project.

Why should we use stories to counter anti-vaccination conspiracy theories? [Read our review paper](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/g5r8z).

What photos should – and shouldn't – be used in public communication about vaccination? [Find out in the blogpost](https://alelazic.blogspot.com/2020/12/good-photos-for-public-communication.html) I wrote, with links to 150 examples of good photos that are open and free to use.
