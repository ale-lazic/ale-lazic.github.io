## About me

I am a PhD Researcher at the University of Belgrade ([LIRA Lab](https://lira.f.bg.ac.rs/en/)). 

My current research explores how social context influences our health decisions and its implications for policy and public communication (e.g. in the media). [Find more in #HealthComm](https://ale-lazic.github.io/healthcomm.html).

I am also interested in how people decide to help others and contribute to the public good. [Find more in #SocialDilemmas](https://ale-lazic.github.io/socialdilemmas.html).

I am actively engaged in promoting open research data sharing as well as improving the inclusivity and accessibility of open science. [Find more in #OpenScience](https://ale-lazic.github.io/openscience.html).

If you want to get on my good side, ask me about my next half-marathon.
