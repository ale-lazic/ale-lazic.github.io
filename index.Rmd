## About me

I am a social psychology PhD Candidate and Research Assistant at the University of Belgrade Department of Psychology ([LIRA Lab](https://lira.f.bg.ac.rs/en/)). 

My PhD project explores how people make vaccination decisions in social interactions with others and its implications for public communication, using online experiments and media content analysis. More broadly, I am interested in how people decide to help others and contribute to the public good.

Since 2022, I am part of the research team of the [Reason4Health project](https://reasonforhealth.f.bg.ac.rs/en/). My main role is to lead and coordinate a content analysis study of online media coverage of alternative medicine in Serbia. 

I co-founded and maintain LIRA's open access repository of psychological instruments in Serbian ([REPOPSI](https://osf.io/5zb8p/)).

In my spare time, I like to draw, dabble in #SciComm, and teach myself R. I created this website with [{distill}](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and [{postcards}](https://github.com/seankross/postcards).
