## About me

I am a social psychology PhD Candidate and Research Assistant at the University of Belgrade Department of Psychology ([LIRA](https://lira.f.bg.ac.rs/en/)). 

My PhD project explores how people make vaccination decisions and its implications for public communication, using online experiments and media content analysis. More broadly, I am interested in how people decide to help others and contribute to the public good.

I developed and lead LIRA's open repository of psychological instruments in Serbian ([REPOPSI](https://osf.io/5zb8p/)).

In my spare time, I like to draw, dabble in [#SciComm](https://alelazic.blogspot.com), and teach myself R. I created this website with [{distill}](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and [{postcards}](https://github.com/seankross/postcards).
