I am a social psychology PhD candidate and research assistant at the University of Belgrade Department of Psychology ([LIRA](https://lira.f.bg.ac.rs/en/)). 

My PhD project explores how people make vaccination decisions and its implications for public communication, using online experiments and media content analysis. More broadly, I am interested in how people decide to help others and contribute to the public good.

I developed and lead LIRA's open repository of psychological instruments in Serbian ([REPOPSI](https://osf.io/5zb8p/)).

I hold a master's and a bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Belgrade.

In my spare time, I like to draw, teach myself R, and do [#SciComm](https://alelazic.blogspot.com/).

_The rest of the website is under construction._
