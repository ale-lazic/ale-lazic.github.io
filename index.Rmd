## About me

Hello! I am a PhD Researcher at the University of Belgrade ([LIRA Lab](https://lira.f.bg.ac.rs/en/)). My current research explores how social context influences our health decisions and its implications for policy and public communication (e.g. in the media). I am engaged also in promoting open research data sharing as well as improving the inclusivity and accessibility of open science.

For a list of my publications and outreach activities, please see my [CV](https://ale-lazic.github.io/cv.html).

#### Public communication about vaccination and health

**How do Serbian online media report about alternative medicine?** I led a content analysis study as part of the Reason4Health project.

**How do Serbian online media report about vaccination rates?** [Read the paper](https://psyarxiv.com/nqjb9/) stemming from my PhD project. 

### Open Science

### Biases in Social Dilemmas

I co-founded and maintain LIRA's open access repository of psychological instruments in Serbian ([REPOPSI](https://osf.io/5zb8p/)).

In my spare time, I like to draw, dabble in #SciComm, and teach myself R. I created this website with [{distill}](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and [{postcards}](https://github.com/seankross/postcards).
