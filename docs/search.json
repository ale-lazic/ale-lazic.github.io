REPOPSI allows everyone\r\n            to freely access and share open psychological scales, tests,\r\n            and other instruments in Serbian. Use REPOPSI for\r\n            your next project!\r\n            In 2022-2023, I led an EOSC Future and Research Data\r\n            Alliance funded REPOPSI improvement project. If words such\r\n            as FAIR, TRUST, and metadata excite you, go here to learn\r\n            about REPOPSI project outputs.\r\n            Even more about REPOPSI, including all of the talks and\r\n            workshops I gave, is here.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n             With the international community ABRIR, I advocate for open\r\n            and equitable big team science.
